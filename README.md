## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.  
Example:  
- **CPU + Motherboard**: Baseline Computer Component; Compatible with Motherboard AM5 socket; thermal design power within capacity of CPU cooler; Supports memory controller with DDR5-5000 Motherboard capability and Memeory requirement; PCIe Gen5 lanes for Graphics Card (ready for future upgrades) with back-ward compatiblity to Gen4 devices such as with the selected GPU and memory modules.
- **CPU Cooler**: 154 mm fits within alloted Case CPU cooler clearance of 155mm; Dual-tower heatsink does not obstruct memory modules (DDR5 height complaint), thermal dissipation capacity sufficient for suggested CPU Thermal Design Power
- **RAM**: Form factor compatible with motherboard's two out of four 288-pin DIMM slots; speed compatible with motherboard's memory speed (DDR5-6000); size of each module compatible w/ DIMM capacity of each socket (32 GiB per socket); Fits 32/192 GB of the Motherboard Memory Capacity.  
- **GPU**: Compatible with the Motherboard's PCIe 4.0x16 slot; 300mm graphics card length fits within 420 mm case clearance; 2.5-slot card thickness supported by sufficient expansion slot layout; power consumption within suggested PSU capacity through PSU provided 8-pin power connectors.
- **Storage 1 (SSD)**: Compatible with the Motherboard's two out of two M.2 2280 slots (5th Gen: 2580/25110 M-key and 4th Gen:2280/22110 M-key);
- **Storage 2 (HDD)**: Compatible with motherboard’s one out of four SATA (Gb/s) ports; 2.5" drive form factor supported by case internal 2.5" drive bays
- **Power Supply**: Fits in case (PSU mount supports size ATX)
- **Case**: Supports micro ATX motherboard form factor; drive bays compatible with Storage 2 (2.5"), video card length (300 mm) fits in case (420 mm max), CPU cooler height (154 mm) fits in case (155 mm max), supports size of PSU (ATX)
- **Case Fans**: Fan size compatible with case fan mounts (3x120 mm fans)

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱105,000
- **Final Total**: ₱103,245
- ✅ Within budget
- Micro ATX motherboard reduces motherboard cost but reduces space for expansion cards

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Reflections on:  
- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)  
- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents  
- What the group learned about PC components and system design
